  <h1>Privacy Policy (Keywords.app)</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> January 21, 2026</p>

  <h2>1. Overview</h2>
  <p>This Privacy Policy explains how In House Advantage LLC (“In House Advantage”, “we”, or “us”) collects, uses, and protects personal information when you use the Keywords.app mobile applications (iOS and future Android), the website at https://keywords.app, and related services (collectively, the “Service”).</p>
  <p>By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, please do not use the Service.</p>

  <p><strong>Data storage and Google Ads access (summary for app stores)</strong><br>
  Keywords.app uses Google OAuth to access your own Google Ads account data with limited scopes (profile email and Google Ads) so you can view and analyze your campaigns in the app. We store your account email and encrypted OAuth tokens on our servers, but <strong>we do not store or aggregate any Google Ads campaign or performance data on our servers; that data is processed and stored only on your device and is removed when you log out or uninstall the app.</strong></p>

  <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>

  <h3>2.1 Account and Contact Information</h3>
  <p>When you create an account or communicate with us, we may collect:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Email address (required).</li>
    <li>Optional profile details you may choose to provide now or in the future, such as name, profile photo, and phone number.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>2.2 Connected Google Account Information</h3>
  <p>If you connect a Google account to use the Google Ads integration, we receive:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>OAuth access and refresh tokens associated with your Google account, currently with scopes limited to your profile email and Google Ads.</li>
    <li>Your Google account email address for identification and access control.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Tokens are stored in encrypted form and used only to access your Google Ads data on your behalf as part of the Service.</p>

  <h3>2.3 Google Ads Data (On‑Device Only)</h3>
  <p>When you connect your Google account, the app may retrieve Google Ads campaign and performance data so you can view and analyze it in the app.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Google Ads data is stored and processed only on your device.</li>
    <li>We do not store Google Ads metrics or campaign data on our servers and do not aggregate it server‑side.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>2.4 Usage and Device Information</h3>
  <p>We may automatically collect certain information when you use the Service, such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Device type, operating system, app version, and device identifiers.</li>
    <li>Log information such as IP address, pages or screens viewed, time and date of use, and error or crash data.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This information is generally collected using standard web and app technologies and used to operate, secure, and improve the Service.</p>

  <h3>2.5 Payment and Transaction Information</h3>
  <p>If you purchase a subscription or in‑app product, payment is processed by the relevant app store or payment provider (for example, Apple or Stripe). We do not receive your full payment card number. We may receive limited transaction information such as subscription status, product purchased, and billing period.</p>

  <h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>
  <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Create and manage your account and provide the Service.</li>
    <li>Connect to your Google account (if you choose) and retrieve Google Ads data for your use in the app.</li>
    <li>Communicate with you, including service‑related messages and support responses.</li>
    <li>Operate, maintain, and improve the app, website, and infrastructure.</li>
    <li>Comply with legal obligations and enforce our Terms of Service.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do not sell your personal information.</p>

  <h2>4. Legal Bases (EEA/UK Users)</h2>
  <p>Where GDPR or similar laws apply, we process personal information based on:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Performance of a contract: to provide and maintain your account and the Service you request.</li>
    <li>Legitimate interests: to improve the Service, prevent abuse, and protect our legal rights, where these interests are not overridden by your rights.</li>
    <li>Consent: for certain communications or optional features, which you may withdraw at any time.</li>
    <li>Compliance with law: where necessary to comply with legal obligations.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. How Long We Keep Information</h2>
  <p>We keep personal information only as long as necessary for the purposes described in this policy or as required by law.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Account email addresses as business records:</strong> Your account email is treated as a business record. After your account is closed, we retain your email address in plain form for up to 90 days for record‑keeping and to resolve account‑related questions.</li>
    <li><strong>Hashing after 90 days:</strong> After this period, we convert your email address into a non‑reversible hash. The hash cannot be used to contact you and is used only to confirm that a particular email address previously corresponded to an account (for example, if you contact us and need to prove prior usage).</li>
    <li><strong>Absolute deletion on request:</strong> You may request absolute deletion of your personal information. Subject to legal obligations to retain certain records, we will delete your personal information from our active systems within 3 business days of verifying your request.</li>
    <li><strong>Google Ads data and tokens:</strong> Google Ads data in the app is stored on your device and is removed when you log out of the app or uninstall it. Encrypted Google OAuth tokens are retained only as long as needed to provide access to your Google Ads data and are deleted when you disconnect your Google account or delete your account.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. How We Share Information</h2>
  <p>We may share personal information in these limited circumstances:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Service providers:</strong> With third‑party vendors that help us provide the Service (for example, hosting, email delivery, analytics, and payment processing), under appropriate confidentiality and data protection obligations. Current providers may include Google Analytics, Resend, Xano, and Stripe.</li>
    <li><strong>Legal and safety:</strong> When required by law or legal process, or when necessary to protect our rights, property, or safety, or that of users or others.</li>
    <li><strong>Business transfers:</strong> In connection with a merger, acquisition, financing, or sale of all or part of our business, personal information may be transferred as part of the transaction, subject to this Policy or a successor policy that is at least as protective.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do not share your Google Ads campaign metrics with third parties for their independent marketing or analytics purposes.</p>
