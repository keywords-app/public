  <p>The Service is provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis, without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied.</p>
  <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, we disclaim all implied warranties, including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non‑infringement, and we do not warrant that the Service will be uninterrupted, error‑free, secure, or that results or data will be accurate or reliable.</p>

  <h2>10. Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>In House Advantage will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits, revenue, data, goodwill, or business opportunities arising out of or related to your use of or inability to use the Service.</li>

  <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow certain limitations, so some of the above may not apply to you.</p>
